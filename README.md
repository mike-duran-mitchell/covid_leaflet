An experiment using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) and data scraped from https://projects.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/cases-by-zip. Files are still cluttered because I'm just trying to learn leaflet and [Turf](http://turfjs.org/) while having some data that is relevant for me and comparable as the entire world is doing inference off of similar data.

# Using CoreUI Free React Admin Template v3

CoreUI is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The CoreUI Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – CoreUI covers them all!
